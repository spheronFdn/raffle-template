# Raffle Template

## Description

**Raffle Template** is a simple NFT raffle application designed to streamline the process of hosting NFT raffles for various projects. This template provides a custom raffle smart contract and a user-friendly application to manage raffles. It allows the owner of the contract to put an NFT up for raffle, enables users to purchase raffle entries, and facilitates the random selection of a winner. The primary goal is to simplify the creation of NFT raffle platforms, making it easier for project owners to market their NFT projects.

### Why did we build this?

The motivation behind this project is to eliminate the complexities associated with developing a raffle platform from scratch. By offering this template, we aim to empower anyone interested in starting a raffle for their NFT project. This template can serve as the foundation for creating more advanced raffle platforms, such as raffling multiple NFTs simultaneously or entire NFT collections.

## Technical Terminology

## Usage

### Owner's Perspective

1. **Deployment**: Deploy the raffle contract on any blockchain of your choice using deployment tools like Hardhat, Remix, or Thirdweb.

2. **Admin Dashboard**: Access the admin dashboard, where you can initiate a raffle by providing the NFT address and token ID of the NFT you want to raffle off. As the contract owner, you automatically have access to the admin panel.

3. **Ticket Price**: Customize the ticket price for the raffle.

4. **Withdraw Funds**: After the raffle concludes, you can withdraw the funds collected from ticket sales.

5. **Select Winner**: Use the "Select Winner" button to randomly choose a winner from the raffle entries. This entire process occurs on the blockchain, ensuring transparency in the raffle.

6. **Winner Rewards**: The winner is automatically awarded the NFT to their address once selected by the owner.

### User's Perspective

As a user interested in participating in the ongoing raffle, here's how you can get involved:

1. **Access the Raffle Platform**: Visit the raffle platform's website or application. You can typically find the platform's link or access point through the project's marketing materials or community channels.

2. **Browse Ongoing Raffles**: Once on the platform, you'll likely find a list of ongoing raffles or upcoming events. Browse through the available raffles and select the one you'd like to participate in.

3. **Select the Raffle**: Click on the raffle you're interested in to view more details, including the NFT that's up for grabs, the ticket price, and the remaining time until the raffle ends.

4. **Confirmation**: After purchasing your entry tickets, you should receive a confirmation that you're now part of the raffle. The platform may provide you with a unique ticket number for reference.

5. **Wait for the Draw**: Once you've entered the raffle, all that's left to do is wait for the draw. Keep an eye on the platform for updates on when the raffle will conclude and the winner will be chosen.

6. **Winner Announcement**: If you're the lucky winner, you'll receive the NFT prize automatically to your connected wallet. The platform will typically announce the winner, adding an element of excitement to the process.
